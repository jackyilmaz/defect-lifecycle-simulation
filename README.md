# Defect Lifecycle Simulation

This repository demonstrates a structured simulation of a real-world defect lifecycle in an Agile SDLC environment.

It showcases how defects are:

- Reported
- Triaged
- Assigned
- Fixed
- Retested
- Closed
- Reopened
- Escalated to Hotfix
- Analyzed via Postmortem

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Severity vs Priority differentiation
- Duplicate bug triage
- Regression impact analysis
- Root Cause documentation
- Production incident escalation
- Postmortem reporting
- QA–Dev collaboration simulation

## Objective

To demonstrate process maturity and understanding of defect lifecycle management beyond basic test case writing.

This project reflects structured QA thinking aligned with enterprise Agile environments.
